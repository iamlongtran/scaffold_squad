Jake is a computational protein biology researcher. He wants to find, design, and implement natural protein motifs in a de novo design environment. He wants the process to be quick, user friendly, and amenable to plug into his other software in-house (StableDiffusion, AlphaFold, etc.). Jake is comfortable with using software and computational tools in his research, and is also comfortable with learning new software platforms.
Specifcally, the goal for this tool is to sample metal binding motif.
