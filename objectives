ChemE 546 project
Generate motifs for metal binding
Generate something that can score amino acids for which would be best to use in motif
Lanthanides, other biologically relevant metals
Software would have to understand the preferred coordination geometries, bond distances, and coordinating atom types for specific ions
use data from the Cambridge Structural Database to generate arrangements of coordinating atoms around ions of interest.
The coordinating atoms would be from molecular structures with amino acid analogs, e.g pyridines (for his) and carboxyl groups (asp/glu) → then build inverse rotamers based on the coordinating atom placements

Impact of this project:
These motifs can be used for designing enzymes, biosensors, proteins to purify lanthanides and other metals, ETC metal coordination

Tasks:
Getting all data → pipeline that takes data from cambridge data base, RCSB, InterMetalDB and then turn it into something we can use
There are already existing databases for metal binding so use that instead of cambridge data base (advice from Dave)
Hard code periodic table → but only use subset for actual coordinating
Extract features → valency of ions, size, coordinates, position data, polarity scores, electronegativity, bulkiness, charge of residues, pi bonding (aromatic residues)
ML on features to get scores
Graph neural network bc using structures


Build motifs/active sites
